The files in this directory are used for building the Ready Lisp disk image
(ReadyLisp.dmg).

If any of the component versions are updated, then Background.graffle should
be edited (with OmniGraffle), and the resulting image re-exported.  Here are
the steps that I use:

 1. Open Background.graffle with OmniGraffle.  It was created with OmniGraffle
    Professional 5.

 2. Edit the version numbers as needed.

 3. Make sure nothing is selected.

 4. Choose menu option: File | Export... (Command-Option-E)

 5. Export the image to "dist/image.png" with the following settings, after
    unchecking everything:

      Export Area:        Current Canvas
      Format:             PNG bitmap image
      Scale:              100%
      Bitmap Resolution:  72 dots per inch

 6. Once the file is saved, you can exit OmniGraffle.  Nothing more needs to
    be done except to run "make", or "make disk-image" if you already did a
    make but then realized you forgot to update the background image (it
    happens!).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the disk image is built, there are several sanity checks that should be
performed, to make sure that everything works together:

  - Test if C-h f mapcar RET takes you to the HyperSpec info pages
  - Test if C-h i m sbcl RET takes you to the SBCL manual
  - Test if M-. mapcar RET takes you to the source code
  - Test that the system runs successively on a PowerPC system
  - Test whether a new package can be installed using asdf-install
  - Test running it on a virgin installation of Leopard

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, there are several steps to be performed to complete the release:

  - Update the background image
  - Update the git repositories
  - Update the NEWS file
  - Update the Ready Lisp project page to indicate the new version(s)
  - Upload the new files to the FTP repository
  - Sign the disk image with GnuPG
  - Copy the disk image file to pub/lisp/ready-lisp
  - Add an MD5 for the image and the signature to MD5SUMS.txt
  - Announce the new version on my computing blog
  - Post the new version info to apple.com software downloads
  - Post the new version info to comp.lang.lisp
  - Post the new version info to coolosxapps.com
  - Post the new version info to freshmeat.net
  - Post the new version info to iusethis.com
  - Post the new version info to linuxlinks.com
  - Post the new version info to macupdate.com
  - Post the new version info to versiontracker.com
